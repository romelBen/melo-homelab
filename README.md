# Melo-homelab
Melo-homelab is a homelab which I have updated that includes IaC and GitOps processes using the latest technologies that is being experimented.

## TO-DO
Will be updating the techologies and instructions on how it's setup.

## Acknowledgements
A great inspiration for this project is from [Khue's homelab](https://github.com/khuedoan/homelab). Majority of the changes will be from that project, and my changes will deal with implementing my Raspberry Pis.

In setting up k3s, I took inspiration from Techno Tims repository [k3s-anisble](https://github.com/techno-tim/k3s-ansible).
