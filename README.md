Melo is suppose to be my name mix together without an "R", or Melo can be understood with *Merlo* which is a place connected to the enchanting presense of blackbirds has nothing to do with homelabs. So back to what this project is about! This repository includes IaC and GitOps processes using the latest technologies.

## Debian Version History
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_version_history

## Installation Setup of Services
I have separated the installation process in 2 areas:
* Setup k3s on Raspberry Pi's (being my `master` nodes) and Dell Optiplex's (being my `nodes`).
* Setup the necessary settings such as `apt-update`/`apt-upgrade`, `ntp`, `ssh`, `sudo`, `pxe_server` (unnecessarry if this was done manually), and security settings to have it secure.

1. To interact with setting/removing k3s, be in the root directory and input the following commands:
```shell

# To install k3s on nodes:
make k3s-setup

# To uninstall k3s on nodes (if an issue or hiccup happens to start from the beginning):
make k3s-reset
```

2. Once k3s has been installed successfully, you will need to run one simple command to have all services fully deployed onto your nodes:
```shell
make
```

3. And presto!

## Future Enhancements To Add
- [ ] Look into implementing Talos rather than Debian. (Talos has been highly debated if it should be used at all. Talos is API driven and removes `ssh` or access to the nodes themselves.)
- [ ] Give a rundown of each resource that I am utilizing and including it into the README.md
- [ ] I need to find a better way of organizing the deployment. I feel the Makefile's in each directory can be confusing for others.

### Acknowledgements
A great inspiration for this project is from [Khue's homelab](https://github.com/romelben/homelab). Majority of the changes will be from his project, and my changes will deal with implementing my Raspberry Pis as well as small changes.

In setting up k3s, I took inspiration from Techno Tim's repository [k3s-anisble](https://github.com/techno-tim/k3s-ansible) by pruning the unnecessarry code and modifying it to my needs.

A shoutout to [thorian93](https://github.com/thorian93) where I used a couple of Ansible roles to use in my home project.
