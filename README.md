Melo is suppose to be my name mix together without an "R", or Melo can be understood with *Merlo* which is a place connected to the enchanting presense of blackbirds has nothing to do with homelabs. So back to what this project is about! This repository includes IaC and GitOps processes using the latest technologies.

## Debian Version History

## Installation Setup of Services
I have separated the installation process in 2 areas:
* Setup k3s on Raspberry Pi's (being my `master` nodes) and Dell Optiplex's (being my `nodes`).
* Setup the necessary settings such as `apt-update`/`apt-upgrade`, `ntp`, `ssh`, `sudo`, `pxe_server` (unnecessarry if this was done manually), and security settings to have it secure.

1. To interact with setting/removing k3s, be in the root directory and input the following commands:
```shell

# To install k3s on nodes:
make k3s-setup

# To uninstall k3s on nodes (if an issue or hiccup happens to start from the beginning):
make k3s-reset
```

2. Once k3s has been installed successfully, you will need to run one simple command to have all services fully deployed onto your nodes:
```shell
make
```

3. And presto!

## Acknowledgements
A great inspiration for this project is from [Khue's homelab](https://github.com/romelben/homelab). Majority of the changes will be from his project, and my changes will deal with implementing my Raspberry Pis as well as small changes.

In setting up k3s, I took inspiration from Techno Tim's repository [k3s-anisble](https://github.com/techno-tim/k3s-ansible) by pruning the unnecessarry code and modifying it to my needs.
